# Narc - The Knock-off Arc (For windows)

Hi there, because it's summer vacation. I decided to work on some proejcts because I was bored. One of these projects is a simple Web-browser inspired by [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/).

It's build in C#, and I know they are making it in Swift. So don't expect anything to fancy from my part... It was just ment as a fun side project.
